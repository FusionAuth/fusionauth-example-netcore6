# HelloAuth: Example ASP.NET Core Application

An ASP.NET Core application using FusionAuth as the identity server. This application will use a OAuth Authorization Code workflow to log users in.

You need to have .NET Core installed to run this code; when written, .NET Core 6 and Visual Studio 2022 was used.

Set up FusionAuth as documented in one of [the installation guides](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/).

To run the ASP.NET Core, either:

* `dotnet run` from the HelloAuth directory to launch the server, or
* Load HelloAuth.sln in Visual Studio and click "Run".

Either approach should open a browser containing the running application.
